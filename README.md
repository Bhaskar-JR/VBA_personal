# VBA Boilerplate 

Building a boilerplate, which is to be used by as a start point for every VBA project was long in my mind. Somewhere in 2016 I have decided to put all the useful VBA code that I am using in a single repository. This repository currently resides here:

[Vitosh/VBA_personal/Boilerplate](https://github.com/Vitosh/VBA_personal/tree/master/Boilerplate)

# VBA Personal

Inititally the idea was to have a repository, for the personal.xlsb.
Then it grew bigger. Then I read an article about Hungarian Notation and I have decided to use it. Then I read [what Joel thought about it and it](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) and I have decided to abandon it completely. 
Now it is pretty much anything good that I write, that could be reused, so I do not have to reinvent the wheel every day. If I have to reuse it, I sometimes change the naming convention, avoiding the bad Hungarian notation and the bad_naming_with_underscores_which_i_was_using_before. One day (probably never), when I have time I would group them in a better way.  Until then, I would use the search option.
    
Good luck, have fun from [VitoshAcademy](http://www.vitoshacademy.com)

Feel free to make pull requests, I would take a look at each one of them.
